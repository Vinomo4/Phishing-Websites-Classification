# Phishing-Websites-Classification
>  Kernel methods used to distinguish between phishing and secure websites.

The aim of this project is to develop ad-hoc kernels that take into account the categorical nature of the variables,and that exploit the nuances and relationships they present, that ease recognizing if a website is secure or malignant.

The number of kernels designed throughout the project is extensive and very diverse, ranging from addaptations of traditional kernels, like *RBF*, to more complex and subject-oriented kernel formulas.

## Used techniques

To solve the classification problem, several kernel functions have been used, as well as non-kernel methods in order to compare performances:

### Non-kernel methods
* Naive Bayes
* Random Forest
### Kernel mehtods
* Overlap
* Simple Matching Coefficient (SMC)
* Multivariate
* Multivariate ID (Using **I** as link function)
* Multivariate centered

And 9 additional methods based on the Gower Legendre similarities:
* GL 3
* GL 4
* GL 5
* GL 6
* GL 7
* GL 9
* GL 12
* GL 13
* GL 14
